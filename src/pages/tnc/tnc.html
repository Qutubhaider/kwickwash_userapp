                    or remedies, and no single or partial exercise of any right or remedy, hereunder shall prevent any 
                    further exercise of the right or remedy or the exercise of any other right or remedy.

                    <b>Severability:</b> If any provision, hereunder becomes, in whole or in part, invalid or unenforceable 
                    but would be valid or enforceable if some part of that provision was deleted, that provision shall apply
                    with such deletions as may be necessary to make it valid. If any court/tribunal of competent jurisdiction 
                    holds any of the provisions, hereunder unlawful or otherwise ineffective, the remainder shall remain in full
                    force and the unlawful or otherwise ineffective provision shall be substituted by a new provision reflecting 
                    the intent of the provision so substituted.
