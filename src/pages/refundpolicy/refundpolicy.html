            Refund Policy for Lawyer Consultation
        </blockquote>
        <ul class="bull">
            <li>
                In the event your request for consultation is accepted, but post-payment due to unexpected and extenuating circumstances, your request for consultation is rejected or cancelled; you will be given an option of opting for another request for consultation or will be offered a complete refund, if you so desire. The refund will be credited to your account within 15 working days.
            </li>
            <li>
                In case your credit card/debit card/payment account has been accidentally over-charged, please notify <b>www.kwickwash.in</b> of the same at
                the earliest. <b>www.kwickwash.in</b> will refund the outstanding amount to your Payment Account within 15 working days. In the reverse scenario,
                if the transaction amount during payment of the fee happens to be less than the actual fee amount, <b>www.kwickwash.in</b> will debit the
                outstanding amount from your Payment Account and notify you of the same.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is mandatory for the users to record and save Unique Transaction ID Numbers, which would be provided at the time of placing a request. This number would be required to address any problems, if any.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the majority of cases, there is no other situation under which <b>www.kwickwash.in</b> will provide a refund,
                except for the condition expressly mentioned above under Refund Policy. In exceptional circumstances, the
                <b>www.kwickwash.in</b> team will work with you to reach a mutually acceptable solution.
                <b>www.kwickwash.in</b> intends to be objective, fair and reasonable in resolving such situations in order
                to maintain a positive and harmonious relationship with the consumers.
            </li>
            <li>
                The maximum refund amount claimable from <b>www.kwickwash.in</b> cannot exceed the amount paid by the user at
                <b>www.kwickwash.in</b> for availing the Lawyer's service(s). No refund in any case whatsoever can be claimed
                from <b>www.kwickwash.in</b> for the amount paid to the Lawyer directly by the user.

            Refund Policy for Legal Documentation Services

        <p class="text-justify">
            <b>In case, you have opted for the documentation service (either creation of a document or vetting of existing document), the below mentioned policy will be applicable. </b>
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Once you opt for this service, based upon the details that you will provide us, you will be sent quote(s). You can ask for other quote(s) if you feel the price is not suitable. On acceptance of the specific quote(s), concerned lawyer(s) will get in touch with you to discuss the requirement and start preparing the document(s). In case you will want a cancellation to be done, you will receive a refund after deduction of 40% of the payment, because part of the service would have been already being furnished. And, once the document is fully prepared, no cancellation request will be accepted and therefore no refund will be made in that case.
